          <em>His Majesty</em> the 5<sup>th</sup> king has
          <strong>commended the loyal and dedicated services</strong> rendered
          by the<b> De-suups</b> in supporting the national effort to overcome
          and address the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. As the
          pandemic<abbr> worsened globally </abbr>and became a reality in our
          own country in early 2020, the challenges mounted through the year. In
          an extraordinary expression of the solidarity with the nation,
          thousands of youth stepped forward to join De-suung.<br />
          <br />
          Within a span of eight months, about 14,000 De-suups were trained from
          38th to 43rd batches in 2020. While many youths were still pursuing
          their education or had just completed their studies and were yet to be
          employed, they sacrificed their time and comfort to serve the nation.
          Today thousands of De-suups have volunteered for deployment in various
          capacities across the nation to bolster national security, ensure
          public health and improve the well-being of our people through the
          De-suung National Service programs.<br />
          <br />
          Further, as mark of deep appreciation for the exceptional services
          rendered by the De-suups,
          <mark
            >Majesty the King has commanded that the State reciprocate by
            providing opportunities for the youth to enhance their skills and
            capabilities so that they can participate even more meaningfully in
            the process of nation building.</mark
          >
          However, to ensure the success of the programs, the De-suung Skilling
          Program (DSP) has to provide end to end services so that there is
          seamless transition from skilling to work. In addition, there also
          exist the need to provide De-suung Career guidance and Personal
          Counselling services to help them make the most of the opportunities
          during the pandemic as well as their transition out of it.<br />
          <br />
          Therefore, to provide the above services, the institution of the
          following services within the De-suung office has established De-suung
          Support Service Unit to cater to Career guidance and Personal
          Counselling, which will help De-suups around the country to make the
          best possible choices and address their mental health.<del
